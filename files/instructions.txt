You are a necromancer in this MULTIPLAYER clone of "Right-Click-to-Necromance!"

Control your little minions by pressing the left mouse button, and they will move in the direction of your mouse.

When your minions get too close to a minion of another enemy horde, they will engage the other horde and deal damage over time (minions will flash red when taking damage)

When all minions in an enemy horde are dead, they can be necromanced by pressing the right mouse button.

The number of minions in your horde and the number of minions you can necromance are displayed in the top right corner.

You lose when all of your minions die, so make sure to choose your engagements wisely. Enemy hordes of minions will spawn over time. These are not meant to pose a serious challenge, but be a source of units.

This is a multiplayer game, meaning the primary focus is on beating other human players, not the AIs. When a player disconnects, all their units and any units which they can necromance are removed.

To host a game, enter the port number you want to host the game on and click "Host." You will auto-join the game you just hosted and the server will shut down when you disconnect.
